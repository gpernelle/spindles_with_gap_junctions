## Abstract
Patterns of waxing and waning oscillations, called spindles, are observed 
in multiple brain regions during sleep. Spindle are thought to be involved 
in memory consolidation. The origin of spindle oscillations is 
ongoing work but experimental results point towards the thalamic
 reticular nucleus (TRN) as a likely candidate. The TRN is rich in 
 electrical synapses, also called gap junctions, which promote synchrony
  in neural activity. Moreover, gap junctions undergo activity-dependent 
  long-term plasticity. We hypothesized that gap junction plasticity 
  can modulate spindle oscillations. We developed a computational model 
  of gap junction plasticity in recurrent networks of TRN and 
  thalamocortical neurons (TC). We showed that gap junction coupling 
  can modulate the TRN-TC network synchrony and that gap junction 
  plasticity is a plausible mechanism for the generation of sleep-spindles. 
  Finally, our results are robust to the simulation of pharmacological 
  manipulation of spindles, such as the administration of propofol, 
  an anesthetics known to generate spindles in humans.
